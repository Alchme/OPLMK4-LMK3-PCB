# OPLMK4-RPLMN3-PCB
Redesign Inspired by the Open Source LMK3. Link to Original Design: https://hackaday.com/2022/06/14/lmn-3-putting-the-op-in-open-source-synthesizers/

This Project Scope is to adapt the need for a RPi 4, to include the support for CM4 Style Pi Options.

Firstly we wanted to fully redesign the main PCB to incorperate Pi CM4 Pin Headers, with ample space on the back for assembly.

Stitching the USB Ports Directly will also be an option, as well as including built in Midi in and Out accordingly.
